## **Security Considerations**

InternSync puts the safety and privacy of its users at the forefront:

- **Authentication and Authorization**: We employ industry-standard techniques to ensure that user data is safe and inaccessible by unauthorized parties.

- **Data Protection and Encryption**: All sensitive data, especially user resumes and profile pictures, are encrypted at rest and in transit. Our integration with AWS S3 further bolsters data security.

- **Compliance**: Our platform is built with a keen focus on compliance with global standards such as GDPR and HIPAA, ensuring that user data is always treated with the utmost respect and care.

---

## **Deployment Strategy**

InternSync uses a three-tier deployment strategy:

- **Development**: An environment for our developers to integrate and test new features.
- **Staging**: A mirror of our production environment. Here, we ensure everything works perfectly before it hits the live server.
- **Production**: The live environment, where our end-users experience all the magic of InternSync.

We rely on Heroku's powerful cloud platform for a seamless CI/CD process, ensuring that new features and updates reach our users in the most efficient manner.
